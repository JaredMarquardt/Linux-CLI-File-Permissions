# Linux-CLI-File-Permissions
Checking, and changing various file permissions with a Linux command line interface. 

# Introduction
In this project I will correct the permission settings for the various files/directories for the user "researcher2," the group "research_team," and the "other" type group using Linux commands. I completed this lab using Qwiklabs while working through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.
